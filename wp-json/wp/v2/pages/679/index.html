This is obvious for political decisions, but still true for small, daily decisions made by common citizens. Individuals decide how to vote, whether to stay at home when they feel sick, to drive or to take the bus. In isolation, these individual decisions have a negligible social outcome, but collectively they determine the results of an election and the start of an epidemic. For many years, studying these processes was limited to observing the outcomes or to analyzing small samples. New data sources and data analysis tools have created a &#8220;macroscope&#8221; and made it possible to start studying the behavior of large numbers of individuals, enabling the emergence of large-scale quantitative social research. At the Data Science and Policy (DS&amp;P) research group we are interested in understanding these decision-making events, expecting that this deeper knowledge will lead to a better understanding of human nature, and to improved public decisions. During the talk I will offer some examples of how can use this macroscope to study psychology and human behavior. And the end, and recognizing that these tools might also have a very negative impact on society, I will present new ideas in distributed computing and how it can help us in privacy protection.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text alignwide is-stacked-on-mobile is-vertically-aligned-top\" style=\"grid-template-columns:20% auto\"><figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"240\" height=\"320\" src=../../../../../_https_/ecir2020.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/joana_sajpg.jpg/_.html alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1247\" \"https:\/\/ecir2020.org\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/joana_sajpg.jpg 240w, https:\/\/ecir2020.org\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/joana_sajpg-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 240px) 100vw, 240px\" \/><\/figure><div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\"><em>Joana Gon\u00e7alves de S\u00e1 is an Associate Professor at Nova School of Business and Economics, Universidade Nova de Lisboa and the leader of the Data Science and Policy research group.

For long, scholars have argued that IR systems should help users accomplish their tasks and not just fulfill a search request. But just as keywords have been good enough approximators for information need, satisfying a set of search requests has been deemed to be good enough to address the task. However, with changing user behaviors and search modalities, specifically found in conversational interfaces, the challenge and opportunity to focus on task have become critically important and central to IR. In this talk, I will discuss some of the key ideas and recent works &#8212; both theoretical and empirical &#8212; to study and support aspects of task. I will show how we could derive user&#8217;s search path or strategy and intentions, and how they could be instrumental in not only creating more personalized search and recommendation solutions, but also solving problems not possible otherwise. Finally, I will extend this to the realm of intelligent assistants with our recent work in a new area called Information Fostering, where our knowledge of the user and the task can help us address another classical problem in IR &#8212; people don&#8217;t know what they don&#8217;t know.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text alignwide is-stacked-on-mobile is-vertically-aligned-top\" style=\"grid-template-columns:20% auto\"><figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" src=../../../../../_https_/ecir2020.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Chirag_Shah.jpg/_.html alt=\"Chirag Shah\" class=\"wp-image-683\" \"https:\/\/ecir2020.org\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/Chirag_Shah.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/ecir2020.org\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/Chirag_Shah-300x300.jpg 300w, https:\/\/ecir2020.org\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/Chirag_Shah-150x150.jpg 150w, https:\/\/ecir2020.org\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/Chirag_Shah-768x768.jpg 768w, https:\/\/ecir2020.org\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/Chirag_Shah-100x100.jpg 100w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" \/><\/figure><div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\"><em>Chirag Shah is an Associate Professor in Information School (iSchool) at University of Washington (UW) in Seattle.

Neural language models and continuous term representations provide new and more effective paths to overcoming vocabulary mismatch, probability estimation, and other core problems in Information Retrieval. Some classic Natural Language Processing tasks are now treated as text similarity problems, and techniques developed for NLP are being applied to classic IR problems, which reduces some of the past differences between IR and NLP. Everything uses machine learning. This technology shift is a good time to think about what is unique and distinct about Information Retrieval as a field compared to neighboring fields.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>From its earliest days, Information Retrieval has studied document collections, information seekers, and information seeking tasks. These topics are embedded deeply in our experimental methodology and how we think about research problems. Neighboring fields focus more attention and computational effort on understanding individual documents, and less on how individual documents should be understood in the context of specific people, tasks, and collections.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This talk describes several recent research activities at CMU&#8217;s Language Technologies Institute. Although each has a different focus, the unifying theme is using knowledge of the search task, context, or corpus to develop more effective representations and models. We find that neural techniques offer new tools for understanding and modeling these core elements of search, in some cases reinvigorating research in stable areas and challenging old assumptions, but do not reduce their importance.\u2013 <\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text alignwide is-stacked-on-mobile is-vertically-aligned-top\" style=\"grid-template-columns:20% auto\"><figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"785\" height=\"1024\" src=../../../../../_https_/ecir2020.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/jpc-Apr25-17-785x1024.jpg/_.html alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1248\" \"https:\/\/ecir2020.org\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/jpc-Apr25-17-785x1024.jpg 785w, https:\/\/ecir2020.org\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/jpc-Apr25-17-230x300.jpg 230w, https:\/\/ecir2020.org\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/jpc-Apr25-17-768x1002.jpg 768w, https:\/\/ecir2020.org\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/jpc-Apr25-17.jpg 807w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" \/><\/figure><div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\"><em>Jamie Callan is a Professor at the Language Technologies Institute, a graduate department in Carnegie Mellon&#8217;s School of Computer Science.
